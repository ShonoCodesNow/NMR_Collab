Hello friends! We'll use this repo to collaborate on a Johnson Lab NMR Data Handling Suite

Some things we'll want to build:

--Early Pipeline--
Shift lists to...  CCPN to BMRB-friendly format for manuscript submission ( I think CCPN might do this already, but it may need automated clean-up)
            to...  TALOS submission friendly format
            to...  Various plots, just as J-coupling, Secondary chemical shift plots, etc

--Nuclear Spin Relaxation Dynamics--
Data prep from CCPN format to tidy FastModelFree-friendly files. Gnarly.

FastModelFree Output to figures, or at least to easily navigable dataframe


--CPMG--
relax data wrangler (residue-level intensity info to relax-friendly files)
relax to figures 

--CEST--
CCPN to chemex data wrangler (already have version 1 done)
chemex dir File to dataframe + figures (already have version 1 done, would like to store in data frame rather than in dictionaries )


--MISC--
